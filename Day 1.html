    <h2>Overall Challenges Faced During Training</h2>
<div class="content">
    <p>Throughout the 28 days of training in AI and ML, several challenges emerged that tested my understanding and skills:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Understanding Core Concepts:</strong> Grasping the fundamental concepts of Python programming, AI, and ML was initially overwhelming due to the rapid pace of the course.</li>
        <li><strong>Library Usage:</strong> Navigating various libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn was challenging, as each library has its own functions and syntax that required time to learn.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Preprocessing:</strong> Cleaning and preprocessing data for ML models proved to be tedious and error-prone, necessitating attention to detail and a clear understanding of the data.</li>
        <li><strong>Model Evaluation:</strong> Understanding different evaluation metrics (like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) and their implications for model performance was complex.</li>
        <li><strong>Project Integration:</strong> Integrating all learned concepts into a cohesive end-to-end project, specifically the movie recommender system, was a significant challenge that required effective project management and debugging skills.</li>
        <li><strong>Presentation Skills:</strong> Effectively presenting my project to peers and instructors made me nervous, highlighting a need for improved public speaking and communication skills.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Despite these challenges, each obstacle provided an opportunity for growth, enhancing my understanding and practical skills in AI and ML.</p>

    <h2 class="centered">Future Goals</h2>
<div class="day">
    <div class="content">
        <p>As I conclude my 28-day training in AI and ML, I have outlined several future goals to further enhance my skills and knowledge in this rapidly evolving field:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Deepen my understanding of advanced machine learning algorithms, including neural networks and deep learning.</li>
            <li>Explore the field of natural language processing (NLP) and its applications.</li>
            <li>Work on real-world projects to apply my skills, such as developing chatbots or predictive analytics tools.</li>
            <li>Participate in hackathons and coding competitions to sharpen my problem-solving abilities.</li>
            <li>Enroll in online courses or certifications focused on AI and machine learning frameworks, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.</li>
            <li>Stay updated with the latest trends in AI/ML through research papers and webinars.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These goals will help me build a solid foundation and prepare me for a successful career in the tech industry.</p>
